# Blackjacked
A simple game of Blackjack with a single catch. The computer will never bust.

In order to run this game, you must navigate to the folder of the game and type

```

```

If that doesn't work, try first compiling all the files with
```
javac BlackjackedMain.java
```
for all files.

# Developer Insights
This game was created as a fun side-project during the school. The goal was to create a card game through the console, while practicing how classes and objects work together.
